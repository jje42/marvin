From Source Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``construct`` requires Python to run.  It will not work with versions in
the 3.x series i.e., you must install version 2.6 or 2.7.  It also
requires two Python packages: BioPython and wxPython.

1. Python: http://www.python.org
2. BioPython: http://biopython.org/wiki/Main_Page
3. wxPython: http://www.wxpython.org

Each website has instructions for download and installation for all
major platforms.

Alternatively, both of these dependencies can be found in the Python
Package Index (PyPI).  If you have ``python`` installed you may also
have ``pip`` or ``easy_install`` installed.  You can use either of these
to install the dependencies::

   $ pip install biopython
   $ pip install wxPython

or ::

   $ easy_install biopython
   $ easy_install wxPython   

``construct`` uses the distutils package of Python.  You can install the
program by issuing ::

   $ python setup.py install

in the ``construct`` download directory.

::

   $ wget <url>
   $ tar jvxf construct-1.0.tar.bz2
   $ cd construct-1.0/
   $ python setup.py install --record construct-installed-files.txt

note the use of the ``--record`` option; Python's distutils doesn't
include a way to uninstall a package, the record option will create a
file with a list of all installed files.  If you ever want to uninstall
the package this list will come in handy.

Windows
~~~~~~~

There is a windows installer available.  It was produced on a Windows 7
32-bit machine.  If it works for you great; if not, sorry, we do not
have access to other versions of Windows make installers on.

On Windows this is the easiest option as no other files are required to
be downloaded/installed.


Mac OSX
~~~~~~~

There is no native .app for OSX; however, ``python`` and
``easy_install`` should be installed by default so following the
instructions for source code installation should be relatively straight
forward.
