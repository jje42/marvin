Installing Marvin
+++++++++++++++++

Windows
=======

There is a windows installer available.  It was produced on a Windows 7
32-bit machine.  If it works for you great; if not, sorry, we do not
have access to other versions of Windows to make installers on.

On Windows this is the easiest option as no other files are required to
be downloaded/installed.

Unix/Linux
==========

``marvin`` requires Python to run.  It has not been tested with the 3.x
series, and we recommend sticking with version 2.6 or 2.7.  It also
requires two Python packages: BioPython and wxPython.

1. Python: http://www.python.org
2. BioPython: http://biopython.org/wiki/Main_Page
3. wxPython: http://www.wxpython.org

Each website has instructions for download and installation for all
major platforms, but the recommended way to get these dependencies is
through your system package manager.  To install dependancies on a
Debian/Ubuntu type system run ::

   # aptitude install python-biopython python-wxgtk2.8

On a Fedora system you can use ``yum`` ::

  # yum install python-biopython wxPython

On Gentoo Linux run ::

  # emerge -va biopython wxpython

For other distributions, please consult your package managers
documentation on how to search for and install packages.

Once the dependencies have been installed, you can install ``marvin``
from source code.  ``marvin`` uses the distutils package of Python.  You
can install the program by issuing ::

   $ python setup.py install

in the ``marvin`` download directory.

::

   $ wget <url>
   $ tar jvxf marvin-<version>.tar.bz2
   $ cd marvin-<version>/ 
   $ python setup.py install --record marvin-installed-files.txt

note the use of the ``--record`` option; Python's distutils doesn't
include a way to uninstall a package, the record option will create a
file with a list of all installed files.  If you ever want to uninstall
the package this list will come in handy.

You can type ::

  $ python setup.py --help-commands

to get a list of all availble commands.  A useful one, if you don't have
administrator privileges on your machine is ::

   $ python setup.py install --user

(read the documentation to for an explanation of this command.)
