      <h1>Marvin</h1>

      <p><span class="code">marvin</span> is a program to help molecular
      biologists when designing protein constructs (truncated versions of
      proteins of interest).  It designs the PCR primers needed to amplify the

      LIC cloning and site directed mutagenesis.</p>
