    <h1>Marvin</h1>

    <p>Marvin is a program to help molecular biologists when designing protein
    constructs (truncated versions of proteins of interest).  It designs the
    PCR primers needed to amplify the chosen constructs, and provides tools for
    restriction enzyme based cloning, LIC cloning and site directed
    mutagenesis.</p>

    <h2>Obtaining the Program</h2>

    <p>Marvin is written in <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>, and it should run on any system that supports this language.  This includes Windows, Mac OSX and Linux.</p>

    <p>If you are a Windows user, the easiest way to obtain Marvin is to
    download the Windows installer that is available from
    <a href="https://github.com/downloads/jjellis/marvin/marvin-0.6.exe">here</a>.</p>

    <p>Users of Mac OS X or Linux operating systems should download the source
    code and follow the instructions in the INSTALL.txt file distributed with
    the source code.  The source code for the program is hosted on <a
      href="https://github.com/jjellis/marvin">GitHub</a>.</p>
