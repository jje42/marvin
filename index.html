    <h1>Marvin</h1>

    <p>Marvin is a program to help molecular biologists when designing protein
    constructs (truncated versions of proteins of interest).  It designs the
    PCR primers needed to amplify the chosen constructs, and provides tools for
    restriction enzyme based cloning, LIC cloning and site directed
    mutagenesis.</p>
